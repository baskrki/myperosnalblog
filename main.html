      <h2>June 9, 2025 – On Being Lazy and Ambitious</h2>
      <p>
        Sometimes I feel like I have so much potential, but I end up doing very little. 
        It's weird how ambition and laziness can coexist. I'm learning to be okay with that — as long as I keep moving.

      <h2>June 1, 2025 – Math is My Language</h2>
      <p>
        There's something beautiful about pure mathematics. I don't need to explain it to anyone — it explains itself.
        I just follow where it leads. I think that's what I want to do with my life.
